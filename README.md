# SFIA-2
# Requirements 
* An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
* This could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.
* An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a * CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
* If a change is made to a code base, then Web hooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
* The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for.
* The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
* As part of the project you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.
